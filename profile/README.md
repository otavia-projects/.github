Hi! Welcome to otavia projects! This is the source code of otavia ecosystem!

## Introduction

[otavia](https://otavia-projects.github.io/otavia/home.html) is an IO and Actor programming model power by Scala 3, it
provides a toolkit to make writing high-performance concurrent programs more easily. Quick learn `otavia` via
